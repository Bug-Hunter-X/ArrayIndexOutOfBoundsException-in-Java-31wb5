# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range. This results in the exception being thrown.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.java`, corrects the loop condition to prevent the error.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array boundaries to avoid runtime exceptions.
